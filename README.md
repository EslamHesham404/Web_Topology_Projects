# Web_Topology_Projects

These are projects applied on graph theory.
The first part is about the ford-fulkerson method that is applied to compute the maximum flow in a residual graph, it is implemented in java using DFS.
The second part is about the Euler therorem implemented in java using Hierholzers algorithm.
